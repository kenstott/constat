  prompt: |
    Analyze employee and workforce data with HR context:

    Be mindful of:
    - PII sensitivity (anonymize or aggregate when appropriate)
    - Pay equity across demographics
    - Compliance implications (overtime, classification)

    Flag patterns that may indicate retention risk or compliance concerns.
