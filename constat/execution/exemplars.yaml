# Intent classification exemplars for embedding-based matching.
#
# Each exemplar is a short phrase representing typical user input for that intent.
# The IntentClassifier uses cosine similarity between the user input embedding
# and these exemplar embeddings to classify intent.
#
# Guidelines:
# - Keep exemplars short (< 10 words) for better embedding specificity
# - Include variations in phrasing and formality
# - Avoid overlap between categories
# - Manual review required before adding new exemplars
